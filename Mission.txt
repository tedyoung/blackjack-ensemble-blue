    ----------> [X] Implement file-based storage of Game Outcome:
                    Each line of the file contains (separated by commas)
                    the final hands for the dealer and player
                    (each card is Rank+Suit, and cards are separated
                     by slashes), and the outcome of the round

                    <dealer's hand>,<player's hand>,<description of outcome>

                    For example:

                    A♥/9♥,3♣/5♠/10♠,Player Loses

                [X] Title case of Enum
                        PLAYER_BUSTED -> Player Busted
                    exception is
                        Blackjack -> Player Wins Blackjack
