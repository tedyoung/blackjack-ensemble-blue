# Ubiquitous Language Glossary

Building the terms for our domain of Blackjack.

* Blackjack - also called a "natural" is when a player or dealer is dealt an Ace with a 10-value card (10, Jack, Queen, or King). By definition, it is when there are two cards in the hand.

* Standing Players - players who did not Bust, nor have Blackjack. They "stood" and wait for the Dealer to complete their turn in order to determine their outcome (lose, push, win). 

* Blackjack Player (Natural) - players who were dealt Blackjack and already won (unless Dealer also has Blackjack, which would be a Push)

* Busted Player - players who hit and went bust and therefore have immediately lost

* Turn - when a player or dealer has to make a decision: Hit or Stand

    * Turn Complete - when a player is either Standing, Bust, or has Blackjack (i.e., they are done playing in this game)
