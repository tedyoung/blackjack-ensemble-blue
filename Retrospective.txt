Retrospective: Mob #11 (Fri June 4, 2021)
-----------------------------------------
	Observations
		In the red a lot less often than previous sessions
		Could have been in the red a lot less for Enum->String
		Predicting more than in the past
		Liked the new order of Driver-Navigator, handoff/transition seemed easier to continue (+2)
		Discussion around options for converting Enum to String, Coupling came up as a factor
			Helped to understand tradeoffs of options
		Refactoring test code is also important (+2)
			Refactoring to separate method felt like moving towards logic in test
		More conscious of smaller steps
		Detour into ParameterizedTest, which was a big step, led to refactoring to a method instead
		Discussion of test driving the very obvious implementation, vs. not test-driving at all and just finish implementation
			Driving the code vs. leaving regression tests behind
	Next Time
		Keep
			Driver + Navigator order & terminology
		Drop
			Don’t push shortcuts on Driver unless asked
		Add
			Driver: Feel free to ask for shortcut
		Awareness
			How long in the red
			Size of steps
			Code being written without tests
			Precision Predictions


Retrospective: Mob #10 (Fri May 28, 2021)
-----------------------------------------
	Observations
		Code driving instead of test driving new code
		Typist thinking out loud
		Typist didn't do what the Navigator asked, and the Navigator didn't correct
			Typists not always asking clarifying questions
		Code formatting
			Lines are too long when window is split into two panes
				Avoid horizontally
		Tendency to run individual tests rather than all Unit Test
		Setup for stub decks is pretty verbose
		Good call for Mike to call a Huddle (when doing two things at once: format of GameOutcome and the result itself)
		Navigator burden held too heavily, could ask for guidance more often
		Take smaller steps
		Disabled test hung around for too long
		Avoid duplication of tests
		Transitions were a bit rough
	Suggestions
		Group mode was unclear: make more clear “Navigator is driving/thinking” vs. “Group huddling and discussing”
		Clarify Typist role: carries out Navigator’s instructions/requests
			Typist can ask questions (say “I noticed this test is empty, should I delete?”)
		Run All Unit Tests
			When to run All-All tests (incl. integration)
		Navigator: when handing off, explicitly state intent to next navigator: where we are and where we’re going
			Call for Huddle if needed
	Like/Dislike
		Liked when team went into “huddle” mode to discuss and clarify intent
		Like: Ask Mob for help
		fail() breadcrumb
		Hard-coding to get test to pass
		Empty test was deleted

Retrospective: Mob #9 (Sat May 22, 2021)
----------------------------------------
(After 1 round)
* Need to work more on agreeing what the intent
* Fuzzy about where to go next
    * Discuss about where we're going
* Ask for a time-out to plan
* Red for 3 rotations, try to get to green faster
* Will try practicing with smaller steps

(After end)
* Best one overall
* Copying deck might have been too big of a step
* High tolerance for annoyances
* Delaying refactoring (including renames)
* Desire to get functionality implemented vs. tidying
* Make sure the error cause is clear before trying to fix
* Good use of shortcuts and asking about shortcuts

Next Time:
+ Mind map for retro next time
+ Game-plan huddle before starting (max 5m)
+ Call for huddle at any time (when lost, confused)
+ Hands/Eyes/Brain/Nose
    -> https://github.com/willemlarsen/mobprogrammingrpg
+ 90m-1h45m - hard stop at 1h45

Retrospective: Mob #8 (Fri May 21, 2021)
----------------------------------------

* More clarity of direction
* Liked retro in the middle (+1)
* Micro-test, focused on smaller classes
* Taking smaller steps
    * Create more, smaller classes
* Hard to remember in the "heat of the moment"
* Driving everything from the test
* Listen to that voice that says "is this becoming an integration test?"
* Notes in chat (+1)
* Don't be afraid to undo/throw away work <-- this is hard
* Shortcut of the day? Continue, maybe 2
* Try out T&C||R next time?
* Keep code & tests Tidy
* Test isolation: be able to understand without looking elsewhere
