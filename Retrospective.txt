Retrospective: Ensemble #99 (Fri May 12, 2023)
----------------------------------------------
Thoughts, Observations
    When creating "bet" field on Player, could we have created the field public first?
    Introducing the game state with the betsHaveBeenPlaced
        vs. the potentially confusing looking at a single player's bet to represent all player's bets

Retrospective: Ensemble #97 (Fri April 28, 2023)
------------------------------------------------
Thoughts, Observations
    All tests pass, ta-da! 🎉
    TCR doesn't work in all scenarios (like this one)
        Forces you to take smaller steps
        Five minute rotations feels like forever
    "Press Play" (means click the green button which runs the current test/run configuration)
    Test setup: Implicit Setup (using a "hidden" setup or before method) doesn't make obvious what's going on when looking at the test
        Isolation = We want "Understandable in Isolation"
    Driving an object (Game) to get to a state vs. "backdoor" loading its state.
    IntelliJ IDEA's extract method that also creates a record (2023.1 or later)
        When there's more than one potential return value
        (Since Java doesn't have deconstruction or multiple return values)
    Finding it hard to read numbers embedded in method names
        Parameterize first
        Then maybe builder
    Converted creation of decks from the old style to use the StubDeckBuilder
        Much more clear what the intent is
    Had fun today!
Next Time

Retrospective: Ensemble #96 (Fri April 14, 2023)
------------------------------------------------
Thoughts, Observations
    Display Name generator to replace camel case with spaces
    Made good progress on fixing tests
        Tedious, it was nice review existing tests and update to use StubDeckBuilder as needed
    There's repetition around creating decks and games
Learnings
    MindNode has duplicate document
    Double-click in the test list window to go to the failing test instead of looking for the stack trace link
    Playing around with test configuration settings
    Using TAB to complete (and overwrite) vs. ENTER that inserts and also leaves what was already there
        CMD+SHIFT+ENTER or CTRL+SHIFT+ENTER to Complete Current Statement
    Type Migration worked the way we wanted! StubDeck -> Deck in the StubDeckBuilder
        vs. Change Signature which didn't do what we wanted

Retrospective: Ensemble #95 (Fri April 7, 2023)
-----------------------------------------------
Thoughts, Observations
    When creating factory methods, what's important to specify and make clear (perhaps in the method name) vs. hiding the details
        What state are you testing
    Multi-step refactoring to change the signature
        Extract method with what you want, then inline the older one
    GameFactory started absorbing all the different cases
    We're refactoring tests while in the red
        Were intending to go back to green
        We were only modifying tests
        We were refactoring to factory method and then moving to factory class when the tests we were refactoring from were green
    Signature Shielding (aka Encapsulated Setup)
        sharing setup across tests (not sharing the state)
    Evolutionary Design of Encapsulated Setup sharing
        Factory Method inside a Test Class, Factory Class with a bunch of methods, then maybe Builder if too many variations (7-10) in the Factory class
    Communication: "can I suggest X" vs. "go do X"
    Navigator to Driver: bring the method on line 71 into view
        vs. runaway scrolling
    Good session


Retrospective: Ensemble #94 (Fri March 24, 2023)
------------------------------------------------
Thoughts, Observations
	Signature Shield for Test SETUP code to avoid the situation we're in where placeBets is required before initialDeal, causing 70 tests to fail
		Start by creating a single test method
		Parameterize the method to capture near duplicates
		Promote to static factory method in a separate class for sharing across test classes
		Make builder to handle other cases
	Refactoring within the enum was good: introduce field (init in constructor), introduce parameter (in constructor)
	placeBets before initialDeal was not previously required, but it should have been (Object Protocol)


Retrospective: Ensemble #93 (Fri March 10, 2023)
------------------------------------------------
Thoughts, Observations
	Triangulating by using different bet/payout amounts instead of different player outcomes
	Language is hard: payout? return? payoff? winnings? bet? placedBet?
		Payout
		Bet = placed bet
	Hard-coded String string in the View class, could have refactored (extracted) from the PlayerResultView and push into PlayerResult
	More hints that Bet probably belongs to Player (parallel lists, passing in Bet separately to PlayerResult, etc.)
	Nice example of exploring the feature, where we're not sure where the data comes from and who's responsible for knowing it
	Things are often more complex when you implement than when you think about implementing
Learnings
	.par and .arg postfix
	Custom Postfix Template plugin too


Retrospective: Ensemble #92 (Fri March 3, 2023)
-----------------------------------------------
Thoughts, Observations
    Good job going in small steps
    Good at backing out early when making a misstep
    Enjoyed the InvalidBetAmount refactoring
        Isolating the validation made it easy to add the 100 check
    Not clear how to effectively do the refactor from List<Integer> to List<Bet>
    Code Smell: Different Levels of Abstraction
        Look for indentation/nesting
    Ensuring integrity of Game: shouldn't update its state if violated the precondition
    Refactoring seemed to go smoothly even though felt like we didn't know where we were going
Learnings
    Records can't have private constructors (for factory methods)
    Record refactoring broken for converting constructor to factory method :(
    Parameterized test with ValueSource (ints = {})

Retrospective: Ensemble #91 (Fri February 24, 2023)
---------------------------------------------------
Thoughts, Observations
	Getting more difficult to not write C# instead of Java
		=> (JavaScript) vs. -> (Java)
	Use more records
	Potential refactorings are interesting: State machine, State pattern, a missing concept for Players (for the different fields in Game)
	Primitive Obsession!!
		Adds meaning from the domain
		Feature Envy is often a symptom
		Will be interesting to see result after extracting PlayerCount
		Fix with new Enum, new Value Object, or new Mutable Type
	Refactoring hints
		Duplication
		Raise the level of abstraction
		Getting to same level of abstraction in a method
	Validation order in a method: validate arguments, then validate state/pre-condition (if necessary)
	Queries: Technical (.size()) vs. Domain (.count())
		if (bets.size() != playerCount()) { (from Game)
		Can indicate a missing Domain class (Primitive Obsession)
	Good discussions today
		Especially discussing about the domain
Learnings
	Records: especially the compact constructor
	Introduce Parameter Object refactoring
		can work on a single parameter


Retrospective: Ensemble #90 (Fri February 17, 2023)
---------------------------------------------------
Thoughts, Observations
    Bets as List<Integer> vs immutable domain Value Object
    "Chop the lines" to put fluent APIs on multiple lines
    Discussion around "Signature Shielding" interesting
    Primitive Exception Obsession
        IllegalStateException -> CardsNotDealt
    Moving placeBets "inward" was pretty easy
    Found (and fixed) latent bug in BlackjackController: ordering of initial deal + place bets
    Did some test clean up
        Nice!
        "background annoyance" to leave it
        "Cognitive Friction" to leave it messy and over-duplicated

Retrospective: Ensemble #89 (Fri February 3, 2023)
--------------------------------------------------
Thoughts, Observations
    Added preconditions that didn't exist
    Sequence diagram in the beginning helped understand the flow
    Working outside-in is good for understanding how to implement things
    Noticed the BlackjackController was annotated as @Controller, but we were able to write PURE tests directly against it
        Makes TDD possible vs. writing framework/integration tests
    Talked about restructuring tests to be "higher level" and create abstraction around assertions
    Noticed some tests (GameTest) had artifacts of old code (deckFactory variable)
    Surprise: placeBets isn't on Game!
        placeBets needs to be refactored and pushed towards the center (Domain)
    Struggling with figuring out at what level to test
        Sometimes duplication is OK across levels/layers
        Don't ignore when it's confusing where tests should go: might indicate lack of cohesion (objects too big or too small)
    Learning how to work from the Ensemble
Next Time
    Precondition: require that all players place bets before taking any action
    Require number of bets placed matches number of players

Retrospective: Ensemble #88 (Fri January 27, 2023)
--------------------------------------------------
Thoughts, Observations
    Good to remind ourselves about POST-Redirect-GET pattern
    PURE (non I/O) vs. I/O tests
        vs. unit & integration
    Betting is a new "state" that the game is in, making the playing process more complicated
    First time experiencing touching the Controller-level code, it's nice but new/unfamiliar
    Ratcheting up the constraints for adding more assertions to a test (making it pass each time)
    Changing code to see what tests break was useful
        Helps find tests we might need to change
        Purposely changing code to (hopefully) have a test fail
    Broke less stuff than expected, but different from just breaking things and then fixing up
    After first test, we could have gone deeper into domain, but did "just enough" to go back to work on the outside
        "subcutaneous"
    Liked taking smaller steps with tests
    Too much copy-pasting, especially of large test code, can interfere with focusing on the minimum that's needed
        Sketching out the test with comments can help
    AAA = arrange, act, assert
        Setup, Execute/Command, Verify/Assert Query
        Given, When, Then
        Format the code accordingly: put blank lines between each section
    Confused and lost about how the posts, redirects, and gets

Retrospective: Ensemble #87 (Fri January 20, 2023)
--------------------------------------------------
Thoughts, Observations
    Mapping out a new feature was interesting
        +1
    Refactoring to extract lambda implementation to a top-level StubShuffler, then introduce parameter to the constructor of GameService
    First turn is always a bit disorienting, trying to load context into your head
    Finished the Random Shuffler! 🎉
        No more violations of Hexagonal Architecture
    Felt more engaged with a smaller ensemble


Retrospective: Ensemble #86 (Fri January 13, 2023)
--------------------------------------------------
Thoughts, Observations
    Using the "custom deck" string from the BlackjackControllerTest
        Avoids having two ways to pass in a Shoe to be used by GameService
    Took us some time to decide which extra constructors to remove/keep
        Much cleaner now
    Discuss in code vs. abstractly
    Interesting to see the introduction of the new Shuffler Port
    Multi-caret editing was fun

Retrospective: Ensemble #85 (Fri January 6, 2023)
-------------------------------------------------
Thoughts, Observations
	Bridging the DeckFactory by refactoring the Shoe constructor (adding the decks() method)
	Replaced constructors for testing with static methods
	Imposing to start off the ensemble
		That feeling of diving into a completely unknown/new part of a codebase
	Everyone (mostly?) knew what's going on by the end
	Took a while to get rid of DeckFactory
		We did it!
		A lot changed, some risky steps (SSR)
			Would be a lot less comfortable if wasn't good test coverage
		Mostly because Tests used
	Can (still) take some getting used to lambdas, especially empty or "no-op" ones
Learnings
	Replace Structurally (when we couldn't see an automated refactoring)


Retrospective: Ensemble #84 (Fri December 16, 2022)
---------------------------------------------------
Thoughts, Observations
    Saff Squeeze
        Pull out the problematic code into a small test to more easily access the broken code
        Alternative to using a debugger
    javap for disassembling
    Sometimes we hold onto code that’s no longer needed
    Lambdas and how it “captures” external variables
        Practice Lambdas with Streams
    Exception naming: without the suffix “Exception” (ref. Kevlin Henney)
    When writing test code, think about “what do you want it to do?"
        TDD mindset: think about the object from the outside
Learnings
    Driver = “Smart Typist”
    When updating tests because of a change to production code, ensure that all the tests still make sense
Next Time

Retrospective: Ensemble #83 (Fri December 9, 2022)
--------------------------------------------------
Thoughts, Observations
	Good practice with Exceptions and testing them
	Design by Contract - “require” (pre-condition) vs. “ensure” (post-condition)
		We write “require” in our methods, and “ensure” with our tests
		“require” guard clauses are best if they’re at the beginning of the methods that they’re guarding
	Domain layer in Hex Arch isn’t required
		But if you have it, Domain must not access Ports
	Naming is hard
		Renamed Card Number to Card Order Indexes
		Trying things out > discussion
			“debate in code”
	Exceptions should have messages to prevent confusion as to what they’re really about
		Better: create domain-specific Exception classes
	Good vibe this session


Retrospective: Ensemble #82 (Fri December 2, 2022)
--------------------------------------------------
Thoughts, Observations
	Changed the test-only constructor to use a static factory method
	Started with too big of a step (all 52 cards), so reset and started with “One”
		Take smaller steps!
	Random numbers are “external state”
	Don’t use “A” and “An” in names of methods as they make it hard to read
	Parallel change (for the ShuffledDeck constructor)
		New way to create predictable deck
		“Feels” like we’re violating encapsulation
Learnings
	Learned about the Supplier pattern (in DeckFactory)
		Pass in a lambda to execute code upon .next()
		Or method handle
	Learned about IJ’s refactor to static factory method
	Learned more about Opt+Enter/Alt+Enter suggestions
	Ligature: love or hate?
		Editor Font checkbox
	Customizing the exclusions for auto-import suggestions
	TabShifter plugin


Retrospective: Ensemble #81 (Fri November 18, 2022)
---------------------------------------------------
Thoughts, Observations
	Went smoothly, no knowledge gaps
		Clear story of what we needed to do
	Was fun
	Was a bit unclear how to “fix” the HexArch violation of ShuffledDeck
		It’s not the ShuffledDeck that’s the problem it’s the Shuffling of the deck that needs to be in an adapter
	Refactored the signature to replace Deck with Shoe
		Felt clunky
		Could have created the Shoe lower in the call stack and introduced parameter
	Unclear how to integrate shuffling (which is hardware and belongs in an adapter) with Shoe or Deck, which are Domain objects
	Reduced indirection in the (now called) GameShoeTest, by getting rid of the GameService “middleman”.


Retrospective: Ensemble #80 (Fri October 21, 2022)
--------------------------------------------------
Thoughts, Observations
    Nice to be doing some complex refactorings
        And keep the tests passing
        And they failed when they needed to

    It’s easier to figure out what do to when tests are failing during a refactoring, than when we’re done (when tests pass)
    Where is the boundary of the work (similar to story splitting, how much is enough?)
    Clean up warnings can help
        Especially when they propogate
        Start with the innermost warning
    Breadcrumbs for cleanup, like @Deprecated
    Decided not to do the rename of the interface when extracting Deck.
        YAGNI?
    Game no longer deals cards from the Deck and now should deal from the Shoe
        Might be a fair amount of cleanup work to consolidate the relationship between Shoe, Deck, and DeckFactory
Learnings
    Learned about what a “Shoe” is


Retrospective: Ensemble #79 (Fri October 7, 2022)
-------------------------------------------------
Thoughts, Observations
    There’s “functional” code in our OO: command methods that return a modified version of the parameter (sometimes)
    Current design for refreshing decks is too complicated, so time to rethink design
    Good first experience.
    Happy to see IntelliJ fail sometimes (extracting interface).
    Yay for Shoe: adding a new domain term to hold our decks of cards
    Intro for new folks can take a bit of time

        Senior/Lead should hold back and let the Team Learn
    It was deck.size() after all!
        Danger of overriding behavior from the parent
        Overriding constructors can be less dangerous

    Factories are stateless
    Appreciated time spent on explanations to understand things

        Depends on how much depth of expertise you’re trying to build
    Interesting how different the steps were than other times a similar code change was made
        Worth experimenting to see what happens instead of assuming

Retrospective: Ensemble #68 (Fri July 8, 2022)

Thoughts, Observations
    Interesting to see the “other timeline” (Ensemble)
    Navigator intent-level instructions “Disable the test however you like”
        As the Driver, I appreciated it
        Comment out @Test vs. explicitly disabled/ignore, if no other tests are disabled, then @Disabled is preferred
    Would be nice to have a “linter” to mark methods in test classes that are non-private, but don’t have @Test annotation
    Was interesting to find that we already had an isGameOver() query method and didn’t need a new one (as originally thought)
    We don’t refactor-organize tests enough
        How do/should we organize tests: along what dimensions and according to Given, When, or Then?
        A result of evolutionary design: we organize the code well, but need this for test code
        Need consistency of where tests go, how to organize them
        (This is a bigger issue when you have multiple tests per prod code)
            Can lose some certainty that everything is covered?
        A danger during refactoring is that you’ve created new behavior that isn’t fully tested

Thoughts, Observations
    If this were “real work”, we’d be more “just make the change”
        And run the tests
    As a Learning Ensemble, it’s good to try out different things to see what works
        It’s how we learn these skills
    We seem to use "Refactoring" to mean automated refactoring (vs. changing code manually that doesn’t change behavior)
    Because we have pretty good test coverage, refactoring is much more comfortable
    Seeing where the refactorings lead to is hard
Learnings
    From the Adapter, Commands must go through the Application Layer (“Service”). Queries can hit Domain or Application Layers.
    Color in Suit is an Attribute of the Suit (Domain concept) vs. how it’s displayed in the Adapter.
        Even though Color is not used Behaviorally.
            Could look like Feature Envy otherwise
        Does the Adapter have all the information it needs to interpret/transform the Domain to present to the world?
        Fairly subjective whether Color needs to be in Suit or can be purely up to the Adapter to interpret.

    Fixing flaky test — if it’s easy enough, just do it right away
        Otherwise put an explicit fail() in it so you don’t lose track
    Love readability of custom domain assertions
        Hard to write and reason because it just looks like other assertThat(), but it returns HandAssert, GameAssert, etc., given the Hand, Game, etc.

    Hard to multitask in an Ensemble
    Doing TDD can be slow, but the payback is big

    Remembering to take baby steps
        Don’t forget to make the test pass before moving on to the next step
        Especially when things are very new and/or complex
    Interesting to look at AssertJ generator
        Too much the first pass
        Put the generated code in a separate package (after making a mistake)
        “bootstrapped” ourselves to get things started
            Didn’t need to fully understand how all of the code works
        Experimented: judge based on “did we reach our goal” (of more readable test)
            A form of “argue in code”

Retrospective: Ensemble #61 (Fri May 20, 2022)
----------------------------------------------
Thoughts, Observations
    Been a long time since I’ve done OO work
        Thinking about boundaries and responsibilities of classes, etc.
    Extract Parameter for constructor was wizardry
    Refactoring with respect to a specific boundary: which boundary are we thinking about?
        Where should we start this next change?
    Let’s just delete something and see what breaks - lean on the compiler to find out what to adjust
        vs. refactoring
            and small, SAFE steps
    Slower: more thinking about the way things are structured
        Felt like a bit too much discussion
            Was unsure what to do next
    The “wall” that we hit was the one that came up during discussion
    In Controller classes, you want little to no logic (if statements)
        Also no Domain state (it’s a service)
    Weren’t sure about “how” the Deck Factory would be “programmable”, so we just started coding — so far we didn’t need it to be programmable
    GameService constructor: unclear who should be responsible for “new Deck()”
        What’s the right boundary for creating decks?
        Relates to the (future) problem of: what if we run out of cards?
        Inconsistency: controller? game startup (bootstrap)

Retrospective: Ensemble #60 (Fri May 13, 2022)
----------------------------------------------
Thoughts, Observations
    Didn’t always Predict test failures
        Only if changing behavior
        Refactoring must pass (by definition)
    We were wrong that we could specify the deck in the Application startup: we don’t know the number of players at that point
        Doing the simplest possible thing can help shine a light on what needs to be done
        Start from the outside, to ensure it CAN actually work
    Hex Arch boundaries helps clarify where code goes: e.g., where do we parse “A,8,K,2”? In the adapter.
        Potentially in a Factory in the Application layer

---------------------------------------------
Thoughts, Observations
    Fun!
    IntelliJ “if” refactoring
    Thinking of how to implement it
    Used the Application test to help drive us and verify assumptions
    Small steps
        Be careful extracting method names with boolean expressions, can sometimes invert unintentionally
    Prefer switch over if
        Prefer Strategy over switch
    IntelliJ: trust, but verify (if reordering/refactorings)
    I thought we’d get this done this session! 😄
        Decisions can take time

    Vocalizing high-level concepts and intentions really helps during hand off

Thoughts, Observations
    Nice to do Extract to Enum (via extract delegate)
        Too bad it doesn’t fix everything everywhere
    Refactoring to enum was not as smooth as we thought, but had rough edges
        Exposed violation of Hex Arch
        Strings in domain classes (like Enum) is a “hidden” (subtle) violation of direction of dependencies in HexArch
    Forgot other observations
    Noticed that a method in a test class wasn’t great—had to keep looking at its implementation
        Hard to evaluate verbally, writing them down to visually compare helped

    Learn more about the Domain (ubiquitous language), especially as we get into edge cases
    Nice to have builders and tests with Domain language
    Multiple constructors can get really confusing, especially with the lambdas
        Lambda matched two completely different interfaces (GameRepository and GameMonitor)
    Navigator provided high level intent of “grab two asserts from previous test” rather than detailed instructions
        High level instructions are faster than lower-level (detailed)
    Noticed when we didn’t Predict test outcome
    FINALLY FINISHED DEALER BLACKJACK FEATURE!!!
        Only took a year or so
Learnings
    Push constant out: refactor by introducing parameter from a constant (e.g., “1” for number of players in the Game constructor)

Retrospective: Ensemble #54 (Fri April 1, 2022)
-----------------------------------------------
Thoughts, Observations
    Simulating the “real world” vs. the domain in the code
        e.g., no need to set all Cards to be Face Down in the Deck
    Feels more “domain-y” by embedded the Face Up/Down state in the Card itself
    Taking small steps to refactor
        Keeping tests passing/compiling (“staying in the Green”)
            vs. making a change and having 5 things break (don’t compile)
    Hard to think in Booleans!!
        Are you sure you want to use a boolean?
    Use boolean parameters with a readable name instead of true/false
    Liked refactoring away from Decorator
    Refactoring with respect to a boundary
        DealerHand = Refactor, Card = new behavior (flip method)
    Refactor to Enum via automated refactoring
        Being OK with making a mistake - trial & error
            Because we can! (And that’s why we’re here)
            Easier to throw away code if you’re taking tiny steps

    Interesting to continue with the decorator way of working
    Some fun issues with expectations in tests
    Trying things out (when you’re not sure) is fun
    Interesting to jump in to an experiment in-progress
    Joy at seeing failures
    Folks called for “huddle” freely
    Test wasn’t correct, was eventually caught
    Just because all tests pass, even with TDD, doesn’t mean everything works as it should

Retrospective: Ensemble #52 (Fri March 18, 2022)

Thoughts, Observations
    Not sure about implementing the (empty) decorator first not driven by the domain?
        Make existing code work (prepare refactoring)
            Should have deleted the override first
        Driving from outside-in might have been more clear?
            We explicitly wanted Decorator solution
    Instead of implementing one by one when test failed, delete methods and use Delegate Methods to implement
    Liked the “line 20 1/2” directive [for navigation]
    Like the huddle
    Not thrilled with FaceUpCard as a name?
        It’s in your face

    Hard after being away for a week
        or two
        Being the driver helped get bearings
    Dislike/frustrated not knowing the long-term path
    Didn’t understand what the later problem actually was, until we hit it
    Liked that we “sketched” out the code ideas to make it concrete
        Discussing in code
    Didn’t like 7 minutes per turn as much, but could be because frustrated by not knowing where we were going
    Despite discussion about options the prior week, it turns out the one we selected didn’t really work once we coded

Retrospective: Ensemble #50 (Fri March 4, 2022)
-----------------------------------------------
Thoughts, Observations
    Got bitten by “simulate” vs “model” the real world issue
    Like how test is serving as documentation
        Exploring how big a test should be — it was larger than we might normally do, but favored one test for documenting
    Exploring in an Ensemble is a great place to discuss issues, especially those that are outside the “norm”
        If it were in a P.R., it might be rejected, or have lots of back-and-forth
        Danger of Guidelines becoming rules without forum for discussion
    Longer rotation time for smaller group seemed good
    Nice to discuss pros/cons for (a plan for) solving the “Dealer Face Down Card” issue
        Coming up with at least 3 choices
        Thinking about the choices in the context of DOMAIN Modeling and where the boundaries are
        Evaluating based on Domain vs Adapter, and Value Objects
            Immediately rejected “let the Adapter do it”
Next Time

Retrospective: Ensemble #49 (Fri February 25, 2022)
---------------------------------------------------
Thoughts, Observations
    Often there’s a way to use automated refactorings to do a composite (larger) refactoring, instead of manual refactoring and leaning on the compiler
    Smaller Ensemble (with 3), much more intense, faster paced
        Maybe use a break
        Longer cycles?
            Until Green?
    Explored more in terms of refactoring and looking for duplication
        Partial duplication with the if(queue not empty) vs. while(queue not empty): seemed odd and revealed a bug
    Noticing some places where couldn’t follow Ted’s thought process

    Enjoyed different approaches to refactoring +1 +1
        Different from what I had in mind
    Coming back after a break was surprisingly easy
    Didn’t stop to think about alternatives
    Can we control “propagation” of errors
        Can I figure out a way to do this and run tests after each step
    Almost a year of this!
    More able to mentally visualize Composite Refactorings
Learnings

    Going last felt harder, having to follow what came before
    Struggled—knew what was wanted, hard to find the next smallest step to get there
        Knew the output, how to test-drive
    Different kind of work than the usual “domain-driven” work
        Also satisfying
    Seeing and getting hands-on in a different kind of builder
    Excited to do test builder
    Surprised that List knows how to toString() itself
    Subclassing and having the cards reference confused as to where it was defined/saved/used
    Prepare refactoring seems like premature refactoring
    Look at the code
    Form hypothesis of why test is failing
    A bit of getting lost what Navigator wants to see vs. what Driver is showing
    Delaying extracting Deck to a proper interface resulted in a bug with the StubDeck constructor (List<Card>)

    Got a better sense of when to add functionality vs. stepping back and refactoring
    Test closer to the class
    Take smaller steps
        Even by hard-coding a value!
            +1
    Noticing Primitive Obsession: PlayerId
        As well as “reason done” should be an enum
    Noting where we use Strings (Adapter) and not (Domain)
    PlayerId vs. Id, depending on context
    Finished Events on the UI!

    Delayed for PlayerResult passing in Player in the constructor instead of individual pieces

    Spike showed us that there was something missing before we could continue — unexpected. We didn’t learn what we thought we would.
    Experiment by breaking things and trying to fix them. And learned things.
    Understanding how “deep” the test should be asserting (e.g., we don’t care about individual cards, just that they have 2 cards). What might break?
    Lost focus on UI, but it’s necessary
    Instead of fighting the iterator, initialized it later in the process
    Should initial deal be part of constructor?

    Why do we dislike recursion??
        Can be harder to reason about
        Method might be a bit long to be recursion
    Liked the suggestion to review Retro goals
    Reducing verbose test method names, especially dropping where the name came from the test class name
        Sometimes think at higher-level/more abstract

Next Time
    Everyone turn on Presentation Assistant to show shortcuts
    Driver doesn't run tests until prediction is made:
        Only when writing test for new behavior that we expect to fail:
            predict precisely why it will fail.
    Ensemble doesn't let drivers run away
Thoughts, Observations
    Word of the day: Snoop
    Nooooooo
        breadcrumbs
    Disorienting after missing a couple of weeks, took a bit to regain context
    We're guessing too much instead of just looking at the code +1
    Didn't make test fail before it passed — never saw it fail
    Liked staying more in the Domain, understanding it better/deeply, and flowed better because of that
    Not enough prediction
    Notice where tests are no longer readable in isolation and fix them
        e.g., CsvGameRepositoryTest
    Move test methods around as we notice them
    Less “pressure” to reorganize/evolve tests vs. evolving prod code

Retrospective: Ensemble #31 (Fri October 22, 2021)
--------------------------------------------------
Thoughts, Observations
    Ubiquitous language morphing — making it reflected in the code
    Good Domain discussions
    Found a bug relating to Dealer when running the app!
    Stepping out of the “inner” TDD loop and going out to see does it work from the “outside”
    Hands-up reminder
    Dying of curiosity why it's currently broken!
    Refactoring focus makes me happy!
    Running the app!
    Look at details/cause of failing tests instead of assuming the reason due to the most recent code change
        Led us to an experiment that broke things worse
    Liked getting rid of getCurrentPlayer()
        Nice that we needed only the ID and allowed us to get rid of the evil getter
Learnings
    Refactoring to move code from a test into the Domain
    Shift-Enter immediately opens file on the right split
Next Time
    TRY not to jump to conclusions as to why the tests failed leading jumping to a solution that's wrong

Retrospective: Ensemble #30 (Fri October 15, 2021)
--------------------------------------------------
Thoughts/Observations
    Absolutely fascinating!
        All the tests passed, even though the code seems weird that it should work
            Seems like there's less code than there should be??
        We now have code that is not necessarily understandable — tunnel vision
    Tests pass, but code is a bit misleading, time to refactor
    Someone is always noticing issues, e.g., unintended change
        Navigator doesn't always notice things, but others noticed
    Mixed feelings about the mob correcting (jumping in) vs. letting the Navigator complete their idea
    Missed working with folks
        Working together really well
    TDD can end up with working code that may not be easy to understand
    Tests are cheap!
        Run them more
    Discussions around unexpected test failures
    Testing from a distance vs. testing closer to the Domain
        Easier to determine what's going on
    Starting with asserts might have been useful — getting confused with incorrect assertions
    Too many constructors in Game
        Not an immediate pain point
    Interesting experience holding back vs. saying something
    Understand for EVERY failing test, truly why did it fail
        Too easy to assume that it was due to the change made and was intentional, instead of an accidental change
    Test naming, if you're stuck, use Given, When, Then to clarify
    Heuristic: Predict if new test is expected to Fail, otherwise just run the dang tests (as experiment)
    Run unit tests all the time, no need to run just a single test
Next Time
    Let's try: instead of interrupting/pointing out things, let's use Zoom's “raise hand”, or just physically raise your finger (i.e., non-vocal)

Retrospective: Ensemble #29 (Fri October 8, 2021)
-------------------------------------------------
Thoughts & Observations
    We were flexible with the next step as things present themselves, e.g., let's go create the Multi-player stub deck now (instead of later or never)
    Nice to go into Huddle to confirm next step (e.g., tiny step)
    Tiny step of changing internal code before changing public interface
        +1
    Being explicit about values chosen for constants to ensure tests fail for the right reason
    Adding toString() to make the test failures easier to read
    Adding equals() and hashCode() for the new value object to make it pass
    Added a fail() that was added at the end of a turn to leave a breadcrumb
        Especially useful if there's an actual break (lunch, end of day, etc.)
    Explore your intuition: even if it seems wrong, there's likely something there that's important
    If you expect a test to fail and it doesn't, dig deep
    Writing a test that's expected to pass, but not sure of the correct string (Characterization)
    Noticed the redundant/useless words in names because of the context (e.g., MultiPlayerStubDeckFactory)
    Fun day!
        Bad “dad” jokes

----------------------------------------------------
Learnings
    Close all other tabs in pane
        If you like it, assign a keymap shortcut
    Focusing on smaller steps, towards the unknown parts
Thoughts, Observations
    Noting down tasks, where we've left off, etc., so we can easily pick up for next time — Breadcrumbs
    Like driving feature from outside-in, especially using Strings for event instead of Enums
        Strings makes it easier to move forward and gets us to green quickly
    Very Small Steps moving from test to test
    Everyone's noticing and fixing little "annoyances"
    Drivers are anticipating what the navigator needs
    Concerned about not really driving from front-end/outside
        Maybe driving by tests from Controller (or Service)
    Not enough considering refactoring when we're at “green”
    Learning to better deal with uncertainty
        Trusting that we'll (or I'll) figure it out
        Better going with the flow of the group
    Creating separate test classes for the “Event” aspects of Game
    “Feel” of the smaller ensemble - more focused, a little less opportunity for “stepping back”
    Felt "smooth"
    Switch focus to Player for generating the “reason done” once we had clarity around requirements for it
        +1
    Was quick to get started in the group, instead of overthinking
    Spent a fair bit of time up-front orienting towards what we'd work on

Retrospective: Ensemble #27 (Fri September 17, 2021)
----------------------------------------------------
Observations, Thoughts
    Used iterator for the first time!
    Parallel refactoring to stay in the green as long as possible
    Tried several things: moving conditions around, renaming, until we got to a good place
        +1
    Spent time on coming up with good names for methods
        +1
        Tried out different names, experimenting, looking for “better” (not perfect)
    Took the time to refactor
    Code is now more “scannable” (understandable at a glance)
        Just trying it to see, and then maybe undo it if not happy with it
    Ensemble stretched the limits
        Lada went “over time” to complete the “thought”
        Group “barged in” to work on improving name
            Make it more explicit that we were “huddling” on the name
            Ask permission
    Liked the “Spike” of copying the method to try something different and compare/contrast
    Driver sketching in comments what navigator was saying to not lose train of thought
        +1
    Instead of moving forward while “in the red”, we pushed toward getting back to green — which turned out to be easier than expected
Learnings
    Learned about Iterator

Retrospective: Ensemble #26 (Sat September 11, 2021)
----------------------------------------------------
Observations, Thoughts
    Very interesting refactoring ++
    Interesting moment of a huge refactoring, driving it from TDD
        Huge change in behavior
        Chip away at broken tests one at a time
        Back-and-forth helped improve understanding of the problem
    “Argue over code that exists” vs. idea for code
    Noticed Ubiquitous Language coming up, and can change over time
        Single player vs. multi-player
        Game over vs. players done
    Extract Boolean Expression to Query Method
    Watching the video of Blackjack game being played helped understand the rules
    Confidence in tests as code grows
        “Downside of having good tests”
    “Zoom out” and step back and think about the Domain instead of focusing solely on the code
    Continuity of mob team is really valuable
    Changing Behavior means TESTS WILL FAIL (and that's OK)
        Be more clear about why a test failed
    Consulting with the mob (“Huddle”) really helps
Learnings
    RED tests are not BAD, only unexplained or bad tests

Retrospective: Ensemble #25 (Fri September 3, 2021)
---------------------------------------------------
Observations/Thoughts
    Seeing small steps: what are we testing and how to observe?
    Current design supports adding the new features
    Felt like we were all on the same page, flowing well
    Wondered if deleting a line was a good idea?
        Experiments are good!
    Noticed code smell of growing number of Game constructors for tests
    Noticed naming drift of existing code, e.g., StubDeck, elsewhere
    Using the GameMonitor in a test (in a Mockist manner) to see end of game behavior
    More noticing of process or naming from the crowd
    Getting better at predicting before running tests

Observations
    Might not be calling “huddle” often enough and perhaps going off track
    Brain dead
    I'm tired
        +1
    Thinking out loud might be confusing driver, might want to call “huddle”; when stuck
    Naming tests is hard
        Hard to figure out exactly and precisely what we want to do
            How do we know it did it (Observation)
        Quality of test name affects thinking - more important that quality of code method names
    Driver anticipated next need
    When Ted was navigating got through a lot of stuff
    Doing Ensembles is what convinced me that Ensembles is a good way to develop
    Eliminate randomness from tests to prevent future flakiness
    Tidy up tests to refine setup
Next Time
    Call for huddle if you (anyone) is not sure what we're doing
    “Thinking out loud”
    Format tests to make Given/When/Then sections clear
    If you're in the crowd (not navigating nor driving), and you see us going off-process (not doing TDD, ambiguous test names, etc.), you are encouraged to speak up.


Retrospective: Mob #23 (Fri August 20, 2021)

    Fewer huddles than normal
    Deal to multiple players worked quickly

Retrospective: Mob #22 (Fri August 13, 2021)
--------------------------------------------
Observations/Thoughts
    Pause and precise predictions: not just pass/fail, but exactly why it will fail
    Thinking about edge cases
    Constants can be useful for getting first test to pass
    Feeling more comfortable being part of the "crowd"
    Look at the Project structure for files instead of trying to figure it out from memory
    Don't try and perfect the design before coding
    Keep looking from the outside-in: how does information come into the system
    The ideal path is a straight line, but it's never straight in reality: what's the next smallest step you can take in that direction
        Sometimes you don't know enough to do a Prepare Refactoring
Learnings
    "You are allowed to break tests when introducing new/changed behavior" (in fact that's the only way to do it)
    Try not to think too far ahead and not rush into new features
    Slow down and think a little bit
Appreciations
    Liked standardizing on Test on Left-Pane and Code on Right-Pane
Next Time
    Use CamelCase names when searching for classes, e.g., "G S T" for GameServiceTest, (also "GaSeT")
        Cmd + L (Ctrl + G) go to Line number
    Incoming driver ensures that the last driver completes ‘mob next'
    Precise Predictions before running tests


Retrospective: Mob #21 (Fri August 6, 2021)
-------------------------------------------
Observations/Thoughts
    Unclear what the new feature was, could have used a list of tasks to do
    Didn't note in the Mission what we had decided to do
    We're smarter together
    Experiment: delete and see if tests still pass
    Seeing the fuzzy big picture turn into small steps
    Good catch to "prepare" refactor first to List of Player before needing to change behavior
Next Time
    Once tests run and PASS, close the test-run tool window to declutter the screen

Learnings
    For "Move Method", helps to parameterize method
    Inline Method is so useful! (and inline parameter, too)
    Thinking about responsibilities
        And point of view of objects (e.g., Player)
Observations
    This week felt easier: responsibilities between classes getting clearer
    Noticing a tendency to "simulate" the real world vs. good object domain model
    Liked high-level instructions and (as driver) asking for more details as needed
        +1
    Seemed focused on doing stuff
    Completed a lot of tasks
    Did some meaningful refactorings
    Didn't have to touch any tests!
    Rushed into next thing instead of doing some tidying up refactoring
        Take more time to think (re-think) names as they're moved or their responsibilities changed
    Sometimes go too quickly past the refactoring dialogs (e.g., replace all occurrences, or field vs. param)
    Running experiments - because tests are so cheap to run
        Make a change and run tests
Appreciations
    Good discussion/question around passing "card" or "deck" to player for "hit()"

Retrospective: Mob #19 (Fri July 23, 2021)
------------------------------------------

Learnings
    Felt strongly about one approach, but let the team go with a different approach
        Not natural for most people
    Thinking about behavior
    Alt+F12 (Option-F12) for Terminal
    Alas no way to delegate into an existing class
Thoughts, Observations
    Overthinking things: try and fail (or succeed) instead
        Stop reasoning/analyzing
    Switched from TDDing the playerTest to moving behavior
        Perhaps got sidetracked by moving isDone() to Player
    Making lots of decisions as a team, don't see how this could parallelized (separate people working on this)
    Might have been "butting in" too much, rather than being asked
    Interesting refactoring that led to exposing Feature Envy
    Struggled more than usual
    Commit to a direction, even if it turns out not to be workable, so everyone can learn
        +1
    It looked so simple to just move a field! (It's not)
    When we changed code to move player is done to Player (with isDone), felt too big of a step and doing two things at once
    Stop thinking, start coding
Appreciations
    Appreciated tidying up the playerDone field no longer needed
    Appreciated the huddles and help
    Course-correction on TDD
Next Time
    Browse the code a bit before the mob to reload the context


Retrospective: Mob #18 (Fri July 16, 2021)
------------------------------------------

Learnings, Thoughts, Observations
    Player class is better than anything I write — good names for methods
    Switching to the "command & query" mindset really is useful, not just a naming thing
    Commit-before-spike (experiment)
    Nice to see introduce new constructor refactoring
    Useful huddle to clarify things
    Reinforced not changing production code without failing test
    More interesting with the "higher-level" mission of moving to multiple Players
        Feels like we're learning a lot more
    Seeing everyone learning
    Can be hard to switch from "refactoring mode" to "writing new code" via writing tests
    As a mob we bring out "the best" in each other
    Like split screen fluency
        Appreciated!
    Deleting code!
    Renaming as a first step towards larger moves
    More thoughtful about goals (why?)
Appreciations
    Ted's video was really helpful
    Appreciate paying attention to code style (spacing, etc.)
    Ted's facilitation
Questions
    Should we shift to more high-level (abstract) instructions from the Navigator
        High-level is harder to think about
        Gives the driver more agency and might make it easier for them to take over when they become Navigator
        Might benefit the entire mob
Next Time
    Navigate at High-level first, only if needed navigate with lower level instructions
    Unfold code: remind before next mob
    Running test: clarify All, Integration, or Unit
    Use "Right" and "Left" when the window is split
    Editor Tabs on when split screen

Retrospective: Mob #17 (Fri July 9, 2021)
-----------------------------------------

Learnings, Thoughts
    Refactoring replacing implementation with a duplicate by comparing old vs. new in a test
        (Characterization-test like)
        Very useful when code can be hard to characterize ("legacy code")
    Overall group participation high
        good cohesion
    Inline just one usage to prepare for move
    Feeling like delivering code is important — self-imposed — slow down, check assumptions
    Like shortcuts being pushed on me
    AssertJ isEqualByComparingFieldByField was uses

-----------------------------------------

Thoughts, Learnings, etc.
    Ted's double-extract-method refactoring golf technique
    See the different approaches to refactoring during huddle
    Reminders about smaller steps and testing
    Manoj called huddle when needed
    Have a more explicit higher level goal
    Interesting contrast to a non-test situation
    Great discussion about encapsulation issue of cards and hand with respect to Player
    Don't forget to clean up the "trail" of changes left after chains of refactorings (e.g., method names)
    Pre-mob huddle and ad-hoc huddles to help clarify goals
    Feels like double-hop refactoring might be too much (other easier ways)
Next Time
    Navigator start with higher-level instructions rather than starting with details
        Trying to find balance between providing shortcuts and higher-level instructions
    Learn shortcuts
        Discuss for next time: push onto driver or let driver ask or let Navigator/Driver negotiate


Retrospective: Mob #15 (Fri June 25, 2021)
------------------------------------------
Learned
    Refresher for automated refactoring tools, understanding of purpose of moving — move to the right place, introduce params
    Took a complex task and broke it down into small actions
    Introduce parameter before moving method over to new class
    Extract Delegate
    Starting at the Domain very different approach than starting from the UI
    Nice to have review of Command & Query core definition
    Try the unfamiliar and maybe it's useful and will become familiar
    Cheat sheet!
        Practice what's there
        Be aware of what you're doing "manually", and try and remember to use the shortcut
        Maybe make your own?

Retrospective: Mob #14 (Fri June 18, 2021)
------------------------------------------
	Observations/Thoughts
		Felt lost the entire time, trouble finding our path
		Liked when Evan called for a huddle
		Less guessing and hoping
		Guessing really bugged me
		Liked when Bini reminded us to Predict before test running
		Being lost is uncomfortable, getting better at being lost in public
		Learned how to test-drive the new CSV repository and then just plugged it in and everything worked
		When tests failed after injecting, felt we weren't on the same page as to why they were failing — get together and understand why.
		Uncomfortable when doing some things that were not test-driven (when injecting and passing down thru call stack the new CSV repository)
		Hadn't run the Game in a long time! And it JUST WORKED.
		Got caught up in trying too hard to clarify test code

		Error stack trace: look at it
		Don't guess, look.
		Don't assume, look.
		Don't serialize through the screen — in the mob, you can be independent for a bit and come back to the mob with answers (diverge/converge)
		Forgot to run tests at the beginning
		Running not quite the right test as asked
		Time flew by!
		Feature is complete!
	Next Time
		Encourage people to ask for a huddle when lost +++
		Use more shortcuts!
		Use the time of handoff to evaluate whether what we're doing is worth it (e.g., clarifying code)
		Do independent "research" when in the crowd/mob.
		Turn off code folding


Retrospective: Mob #13 (Fri June 11, 2021)
------------------------------------------
	Learning/Takeaway
		Characterization test, to test the hypothesis that multiple games were on a single line, turned out not to be the case, disproving the hypothesis
			Characterization test vs. switching to debugger, staying in the work flow (+1)
		Consequences of moving test setup code to a "setup" method vs. a named method call in the test method
			Tradeoffs
		ZOMBIES in action, picking the right tests to move from zero, to one, and then to many
		Failed test to green by just hard-coding the correct answer in the code
		JUnit 5 @TempDir
	Observations
		Shorter huddles/hand-offs — doing the work, less "where are we" and coordination
			More "in sync", flow
		Be aware of specifying the Class name and the file number when multiple panes are open
		More focus on small steps, e.g., hard-coding
		Less "runaway driver" problem
			Learning from past experiences
		Navigator asking for help and mob swarmed for the answer
		More of the mob involved with "navigating", worked more closely together
		Stayed in the green (and noticed when in the red too long)
	Do or Not Do Next Time?
		More discussion? Asking "why are we doing this?" or "is there a better way to do that?"
		Need to be reminded of shortcuts for refactoring

Retrospective: Mob #12 (Sun June 6, 2021)
-----------------------------------------
	Observations
		Appreciated that Lada never hesitated to delete (redundant) code
		Driver careful/aware not run away from the Navigator
		Liked Ted checking on huddle being clear on what's happening and on the same page
		Started writing integration test that could have been unit test first
		Helpful to define carefully the behavior that's being tested before writing the test
		Bini great at providing feedback as Driver to clarify what Navigator was requesting
		Being mindful of what we're testing: what to keep, what to get rid of
		Question: how do we know when to take a step back?
		Noticed occasionally ‘mob start', but liked people confirming that it was done
		Mob is flowing much better: handoffs, etc.
	Next Time
		Technical "spike tests" are OK
		Try: Ted push shortcuts on Driver?
		Make sure the test behavior being tested is crystal clear, naming the method following Given/When/Then can help
		Keep ZOMBIES in mind
		Ted: Make sure to announce Driver & Navigator
		Keep Driver/Navigator order

Retrospective: Mob #11 (Fri June 4, 2021)
-----------------------------------------
	Observations
		In the red a lot less often than previous sessions
		Could have been in the red a lot less for Enum->String
		Predicting more than in the past
		Liked the new order of Driver-Navigator, handoff/transition seemed easier to continue (+2)
		Discussion around options for converting Enum to String, Coupling came up as a factor
			Helped to understand tradeoffs of options
		Refactoring test code is also important (+2)
			Refactoring to separate method felt like moving towards logic in test
		More conscious of smaller steps
		Detour into ParameterizedTest, which was a big step, led to refactoring to a method instead
		Discussion of test driving the very obvious implementation, vs. not test-driving at all and just finish implementation
			Driving the code vs. leaving regression tests behind
	Next Time
		Keep
			Driver + Navigator order & terminology
		Drop
			Don't push shortcuts on Driver unless asked
		Add
			Driver: Feel free to ask for shortcut
		Awareness
			How long in the red
			Size of steps
			Code being written without tests
			Precision Predictions


Retrospective: Mob #10 (Fri May 28, 2021)
-----------------------------------------
	Observations
		Code driving instead of test driving new code
		Typist thinking out loud
		Typist didn't do what the Navigator asked, and the Navigator didn't correct
			Typists not always asking clarifying questions
		Code formatting
			Lines are too long when window is split into two panes
				Avoid horizontally
		Tendency to run individual tests rather than all Unit Test
		Setup for stub decks is pretty verbose
		Good call for Mike to call a Huddle (when doing two things at once: format of GameOutcome and the result itself)
		Navigator burden held too heavily, could ask for guidance more often
		Take smaller steps
		Disabled test hung around for too long
		Avoid duplication of tests
		Transitions were a bit rough
	Suggestions
		Group mode was unclear: make more clear "Navigator is driving/thinking" vs. "Group huddling and discussing"
		Clarify Typist role: carries out Navigator's instructions/requests
			Typist can ask questions (say "I noticed this test is empty, should I delete?")
		Run All Unit Tests
			When to run All-All tests (incl. integration)
		Navigator: when handing off, explicitly state intent to next navigator: where we are and where we're going
			Call for Huddle if needed
	Like/Dislike
		Liked when team went into "huddle" mode to discuss and clarify intent
		Like: Ask Mob for help
		fail() breadcrumb
		Hard-coding to get test to pass
		Empty test was deleted

Retrospective: Mob #9 (Sat May 22, 2021)
----------------------------------------
(After 1 round)
* Need to work more on agreeing what the intent
* Fuzzy about where to go next
    * Discuss about where we're going
* Ask for a time-out to plan
* Red for 3 rotations, try to get to green faster
* Will try practicing with smaller steps

(After end)
* Best one overall
* Copying deck might have been too big of a step
* High tolerance for annoyances
* Delaying refactoring (including renames)
* Desire to get functionality implemented vs. tidying
* Make sure the error cause is clear before trying to fix
* Good use of shortcuts and asking about shortcuts

Next Time:
+ Mind map for retro next time
+ Game-plan huddle before starting (max 5m)
+ Call for huddle at any time (when lost, confused)
+ Hands/Eyes/Brain/Nose
    -> https://github.com/willemlarsen/mobprogrammingrpg
+ 90m-1h45m - hard stop at 1h45

Retrospective: Mob #8 (Fri May 21, 2021)
----------------------------------------

* More clarity of direction
* Liked retro in the middle (+1)
* Micro-test, focused on smaller classes
* Taking smaller steps
    * Create more, smaller classes
* Hard to remember in the "heat of the moment"
* Driving everything from the test
* Listen to that voice that says "is this becoming an integration test?"
* Notes in chat (+1)
* Don't be afraid to undo/throw away work <-- this is hard
* Shortcut of the day? Continue, maybe 2
* Try out T&C||R next time?
* Keep code & tests Tidy
* Test isolation: be able to understand without looking elsewhere
