Retrospective: Mob #9 (Sat May 22, 2021)
----------------------------------------
(After 1 round)
* Need to work more on agreeing what the intent
* Fuzzy about where to go next
    * Discuss about where we're going
* Ask for a time-out to plan
* Red for 3 rotations, try to get to green faster
* Will try practicing with smaller steps

(After end)
* Best one overall
* Copying deck might have been too big of a step
* High tolerance for annoyances
* Delaying refactoring (including renames)
* Desire to get functionality implemented vs. tidying
* Make sure the error cause is clear before trying to fix
* Good use of shortcuts and asking about shortcuts

Next Time:
+ Mind map for retro next time
+ Game-plan huddle before starting (max 5m)
+ Call for huddle at any time (when lost, confused)
+ Hands/Eyes/Brain/Nose
    -> https://github.com/willemlarsen/mobprogrammingrpg
+ 90m-1h45m - hard stop at 1h45

Retrospective: Mob #8 (Fri May 21, 2021)
----------------------------------------

* More clarity of direction
* Liked retro in the middle (+1)
* Micro-test, focused on smaller classes
* Taking smaller steps
    * Create more, smaller classes
* Hard to remember in the "heat of the moment"
* Driving everything from the test
* Listen to that voice that says "is this becoming an integration test?"
* Notes in chat (+1)
* Don't be afraid to undo/throw away work <-- this is hard
* Shortcut of the day? Continue, maybe 2
* Try out T&C||R next time?
* Keep code & tests Tidy
* Test isolation: be able to understand without looking elsewhere
