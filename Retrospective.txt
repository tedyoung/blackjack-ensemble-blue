Retrospective: Ensemble #50 (Fri March 4, 2022)
-----------------------------------------------
Thoughts, Observations
    Got bitten by “simulate” vs “model” the real world issue
    Like how test is serving as documentation
        Exploring how big a test should be — it was larger than we might normally do, but favored one test for documenting
    Exploring in an Ensemble is a great place to discuss issues, especially those that are outside the “norm”
        If it were in a P.R., it might be rejected, or have lots of back-and-forth
        Danger of Guidelines becoming rules without forum for discussion
    Longer rotation time for smaller group seemed good
    Nice to discuss pros/cons for (a plan for) solving the “Dealer Face Down Card” issue
        Coming up with at least 3 choices
        Thinking about the choices in the context of DOMAIN Modeling and where the boundaries are
        Evaluating based on Domain vs Adapter, and Value Objects
            Immediately rejected “let the Adapter do it”
Next Time
    Maybe try 7 minutes instead of 10 minutes for small groups


Retrospective: Ensemble #49 (Fri February 25, 2022)
---------------------------------------------------
Thoughts, Observations
    Often there’s a way to use automated refactorings to do a composite (larger) refactoring, instead of manual refactoring and leaning on the compiler
    Smaller Ensemble (with 3), much more intense, faster paced
        Maybe use a break
        Longer cycles?
            Until Green?
    Explored more in terms of refactoring and looking for duplication
        Partial duplication with the if(queue not empty) vs. while(queue not empty): seemed odd and revealed a bug
    Noticing some places where couldn’t follow Ted’s thought process
    Forgetting some of the “tools” to use
        Deliberate practice
Learnings
    Change Signature to swap parameters
    postfix “.for”
    Select multiple parameters for Introduce Parameter (creates array)
    Refactoring to convert array to var args
        Remember varargs at the end
Next Time
    For 3 ppl, do 10 min cycle


Retrospective: Ensemble #48 (Fri February 18, 2022)
---------------------------------------------------
Thoughts, Observations
    Enjoyed different approaches to refactoring +1 +1
        Different from what I had in mind
    Coming back after a break was surprisingly easy
    Didn’t stop to think about alternatives
    Can we control “propagation” of errors
        Can I figure out a way to do this and run tests after each step
    Almost a year of this!
    More able to mentally visualize Composite Refactorings
Learnings
    Using `private` to figure out which methods were still using the method (leverage/leaning on the compiler to show you where you need to fix things)
    Action Search (Cmd+Shift+A, Ctrl+Shift+A)
    Postfix `for` on collections to generate the for loop
    Ctrl+Y (not “eye”) delete current line (Cmd+Del)
Next Time
    Do an explicit commit before doing a non-trivial refactor


Retrospective: Ensemble #47 (Fri February 11, 2022)
---------------------------------------------------
Thoughts, Observations
    Prepare Refactoring to prepare for multiple player hands
    Copy-n-paste ignores formatter:off
    Test Data Builders are fun
    Getting a bit complicated with the deques and lists and bears
    The 2 literal was mistaken for number of players, when it was the number of cards for an initial deal

Retrospective: Ensemble #45 (Fri January 28, 2022)
--------------------------------------------------
Thoughts, Observations
    Going last felt harder, having to follow what came before
    Struggled—knew what was wanted, hard to find the next smallest step to get there
        Knew the output, how to test-drive
    Different kind of work than the usual “domain-driven” work
        Also satisfying
    Seeing and getting hands-on in a different kind of builder
    Excited to do test builder
    Surprised that List knows how to toString() itself
    Subclassing and having the cards reference confused as to where it was defined/saved/used
    Prepare refactoring seems like premature refactoring
    Look at the code
    Form hypothesis of why test is failing
    A bit of getting lost what Navigator wants to see vs. what Driver is showing
    Delaying extracting Deck to a proper interface resulted in a bug with the StubDeck constructor (List<Card>)

Retrospective: Ensemble #44 (Fri January 21, 2022)
--------------------------------------------------
Thoughts, Observations
    Working outside-in was more comfortable
    Got a better sense of when to add functionality vs. stepping back and refactoring
    Test closer to the class
    Take smaller steps
        Even by hard-coding a value!
            +1
    Noticing Primitive Obsession: PlayerId
        As well as “reason done” should be an enum
    Noting where we use Strings (Adapter) and not (Domain)
    PlayerId vs. Id, depending on context
    Finished Events on the UI!
        +1
    Easier to start from the view
    Very smooth
    Don’t fight indentation — just do it, and reformat after (Cmd+Opt+L / Ctrl+Alt+L)


Retrospective: Ensemble #43 (Fri January 14, 2022)
-------------------------------------------------
Thoughts, Observations
    Domain is concrete — closer to the physical world, makes it easier to understand
    So Excite: see outcome and cards for multiple players!!!
        +1
    What was that bug?!?
    Multiple turns without writing code
    Changing TEST before changing CODE
    Extra effort to make test fail before making a change to the code (player outcome)

Thoughts, Observations
    Dynamic of 3 people felt very different
        Seemed easier to “pipe up"
    Got rid of getPlayers()! Finally!
    Discussion points were few and fast
        Maybe shorter because fewer people - faster sync
    Delayed for PlayerResult passing in Player in the constructor instead of individual pieces
        Nicer to pass in PlayerOutcome instead of propagating Dealer Hand - made testing easier
    Good discussion highlighting the “current player” methods weren’t well named and protocol not being enforced

    I’m still going to fast and not taking time to think. Runaway driver. Jumping to solution.
        +1 :(
    Away from mob, though seemed easier to jump in
    Sometimes hard to see smaller steps

    Figure out what needs to be tested vs. what’s already tested (GameOutcomeView vs. PlayerOutcomeView)
    Liked cleaning up names of things

    Making the test more obvious: e.g., inline factory method to visualize the work
        Made a mistake later (somewhat) easier to find
    When confused: check assumptions, e.g., test setup
        One of the hardest things to do
    After spending a lot of time in one class (like Game) to “switch mental model” to focus just on Player
        Leads to wrong assumptions

    That was unsatisfying. (but necessary). Discovered we needed something else to be done first.
        We learned something, but didn’t finish any functionality. +1
    Spike showed us that there was something missing before we could continue — unexpected. We didn’t learn what we thought we would.
    Experiment by breaking things and trying to fix them. And learned things.
    Understanding how “deep” the test should be asserting (e.g., we don’t care about individual cards, just that they have 2 cards). What might break?
    Lost focus on UI, but it’s necessary
    Instead of fighting the iterator, initialized it later in the process
    Should initial deal be part of constructor?
        Is Game truly in a valid state prior to initialDeal()?
    Even when experimenting, paying attention to WHY tests are failing can show missing functionality, or change thought process.

    Saturday “morning” seems to be much rougher than Friday morning +3
    Confusion around renaming of methods in the SingleStubDeckFactory to clarify dealer options +1
        Before it didn’t matter, now it matters
        Good job looking at usages
    Still some language issues around terminology of “completed” “active” etc.
        Can’t really look to the “problem domain” for terminology
    Like that we’re refactoring and experimenting ways to improve the ‘playerStateChanged’

--------------------------------------------------
Thoughts, Observations
    Like how we focused on Precisely Predicting how tests should fail, helps ensure understanding of code
    Liked coming to a new way of indicating which tests to run: “All” for All Units tests and “Unit Tests” for just unit tests
    Happy we’re exploring alternative ways to solve problems (e.g., non-recursive approach)
    Why do we dislike recursion??
        Can be harder to reason about
        Method might be a bit long to be recursion
    Liked the suggestion to review Retro goals
    Reducing verbose test method names, especially dropping where the name came from the test class name

    Hands-up reminder
    Dying of curiosity why it's currently broken!
    Refactoring focus makes me happy!
    Running the app!
    Look at details/cause of failing tests instead of assuming the reason due to the most recent code change
        Led us to an experiment that broke things worse

Retrospective: Ensemble #30 (Fri October 15, 2021)
--------------------------------------------------
Thoughts/Observations
    Absolutely fascinating!
        All the tests passed, even though the code seems weird that it should work
            Seems like there's less code than there should be??
        We now have code that is not necessarily understandable — tunnel vision
    Tests pass, but code is a bit misleading, time to refactor
    Someone is always noticing issues, e.g., unintended change
        Navigator doesn't always notice things, but others noticed
    Mixed feelings about the mob correcting (jumping in) vs. letting the Navigator complete their idea
    Missed working with folks
        Working together really well
    TDD can end up with working code that may not be easy to understand
    Tests are cheap!
        Run them more
    Discussions around unexpected test failures
    Testing from a distance vs. testing closer to the Domain
        Easier to determine what's going on
    Starting with asserts might have been useful — getting confused with incorrect assertions
    Too many constructors in Game
        Not an immediate pain point
    Interesting experience holding back vs. saying something
    Understand for EVERY failing test, truly why did it fail
        Too easy to assume that it was due to the change made and was intentional, instead of an accidental change
    Test naming, if you're stuck, use Given, When, Then to clarify
    Heuristic: Predict if new test is expected to Fail, otherwise just run the dang tests (as experiment)
    Run unit tests all the time, no need to run just a single test

Retrospective: Ensemble #29 (Fri October 8, 2021)
-------------------------------------------------
Thoughts & Observations
    We were flexible with the next step as things present themselves, e.g., let's go create the Multi-player stub deck now (instead of later or never)
    Nice to go into Huddle to confirm next step (e.g., tiny step)
    Tiny step of changing internal code before changing public interface
        +1
    Being explicit about values chosen for constants to ensure tests fail for the right reason
    Adding toString() to make the test failures easier to read
    Adding equals() and hashCode() for the new value object to make it pass
    Added a fail() that was added at the end of a turn to leave a breadcrumb
        Especially useful if there's an actual break (lunch, end of day, etc.)
    Explore your intuition: even if it seems wrong, there's likely something there that's important
    If you expect a test to fail and it doesn't, dig deep
    Writing a test that's expected to pass, but not sure of the correct string (Characterization)
    Noticed the redundant/useless words in names because of the context (e.g., MultiPlayerStubDeckFactory)

    Noting down tasks, where we've left off, etc., so we can easily pick up for next time — Breadcrumbs
    Like driving feature from outside-in, especially using Strings for event instead of Enums
        Strings makes it easier to move forward and gets us to green quickly

        Tried out different names, experimenting, looking for “better” (not perfect)
    Took the time to refactor
    Code is now more “scannable” (understandable at a glance)
        Just trying it to see, and then maybe undo it if not happy with it
    Ensemble stretched the limits

    “Zoom out” and step back and think about the Domain instead of focusing solely on the code
    Continuity of mob team is really valuable

Retrospective: Mob #22 (Fri August 13, 2021)
--------------------------------------------
Observations/Thoughts
    Pause and precise predictions: not just pass/fail, but exactly why it will fail
    Thinking about edge cases
    Constants can be useful for getting first test to pass
    Feeling more comfortable being part of the "crowd"
    Look at the Project structure for files instead of trying to figure it out from memory
    Don't try and perfect the design before coding
    Keep looking from the outside-in: how does information come into the system
    The ideal path is a straight line, but it's never straight in reality: what's the next smallest step you can take in that direction
        Sometimes you don't know enough to do a Prepare Refactoring
Learnings
    "You are allowed to break tests when introducing new/changed behavior" (in fact that's the only way to do it)
    Try not to think too far ahead and not rush into new features
    Slow down and think a little bit
Appreciations
    Liked standardizing on Test on Left-Pane and Code on Right-Pane
Next Time
    Use CamelCase names when searching for classes, e.g., "G S T" for GameServiceTest, (also "GaSeT")
        Cmd + L (Ctrl + G) go to Line number
    Incoming driver ensures that the last driver completes ‘mob next'
    Precise Predictions before running tests


Retrospective: Mob #21 (Fri August 6, 2021)
-------------------------------------------
Observations/Thoughts
    Unclear what the new feature was, could have used a list of tasks to do
    Didn't note in the Mission what we had decided to do
    We're smarter together
    Experiment: delete and see if tests still pass
    Seeing the fuzzy big picture turn into small steps
    Good catch to "prepare" refactor first to List of Player before needing to change behavior
Next Time
    Once tests run and PASS, close the test-run tool window to declutter the screen


Retrospective: Mob #20 (Fri July 30, 2021)
------------------------------------------

Next Time
    Run tests more often
        +100
    Driver can prompt "run test?"
Learnings
    For "Move Method", helps to parameterize method
    Inline Method is so useful! (and inline parameter, too)
    Thinking about responsibilities
        And point of view of objects (e.g., Player)
Observations
    This week felt easier: responsibilities between classes getting clearer
    Noticing a tendency to "simulate" the real world vs. good object domain model
    Liked high-level instructions and (as driver) asking for more details as needed
        +1
    Seemed focused on doing stuff
    Completed a lot of tasks
    Did some meaningful refactorings
    Didn't have to touch any tests!
    Rushed into next thing instead of doing some tidying up refactoring
        Take more time to think (re-think) names as they're moved or their responsibilities changed
    Sometimes go too quickly past the refactoring dialogs (e.g., replace all occurrences, or field vs. param)
    Running experiments - because tests are so cheap to run
        Make a change and run tests
Appreciations
    Good discussion/question around passing "card" or "deck" to player for "hit()"

Retrospective: Mob #19 (Fri July 23, 2021)
------------------------------------------

Learnings
    Felt strongly about one approach, but let the team go with a different approach
        Not natural for most people
    Thinking about behavior
    Alt+F12 (Option-F12) for Terminal
    Alas no way to delegate into an existing class
Thoughts, Observations
    Overthinking things: try and fail (or succeed) instead
        Stop reasoning/analyzing
    Switched from TDDing the playerTest to moving behavior
        Perhaps got sidetracked by moving isDone() to Player
    Making lots of decisions as a team, don't see how this could parallelized (separate people working on this)
    Might have been "butting in" too much, rather than being asked
    Interesting refactoring that led to exposing Feature Envy
    Struggled more than usual
    Commit to a direction, even if it turns out not to be workable, so everyone can learn
        +1
    It looked so simple to just move a field! (It's not)
    When we changed code to move player is done to Player (with isDone), felt too big of a step and doing two things at once
    Stop thinking, start coding
Appreciations
    Appreciated tidying up the playerDone field no longer needed
    Appreciated the huddles and help
    Course-correction on TDD
Next Time
    Browse the code a bit before the mob to reload the context


Retrospective: Mob #18 (Fri July 16, 2021)
------------------------------------------

Learnings, Thoughts, Observations
    Player class is better than anything I write — good names for methods
    Switching to the "command & query" mindset really is useful, not just a naming thing
    Commit-before-spike (experiment)
    Nice to see introduce new constructor refactoring
    Useful huddle to clarify things
    Reinforced not changing production code without failing test
    More interesting with the "higher-level" mission of moving to multiple Players
        Feels like we're learning a lot more
    Seeing everyone learning
    Can be hard to switch from "refactoring mode" to "writing new code" via writing tests
    As a mob we bring out "the best" in each other
    Like split screen fluency
        Appreciated!
    Deleting code!
    Renaming as a first step towards larger moves
    More thoughtful about goals (why?)
Appreciations
    Ted's video was really helpful
    Appreciate paying attention to code style (spacing, etc.)
    Ted's facilitation
Questions
    Should we shift to more high-level (abstract) instructions from the Navigator
        High-level is harder to think about
        Gives the driver more agency and might make it easier for them to take over when they become Navigator
        Might benefit the entire mob
Next Time
    Navigate at High-level first, only if needed navigate with lower level instructions
    Unfold code: remind before next mob
    Running test: clarify All, Integration, or Unit
    Use "Right" and "Left" when the window is split
    Editor Tabs on when split screen

Retrospective: Mob #17 (Fri July 9, 2021)
-----------------------------------------

Learnings, Thoughts
    Refactoring replacing implementation with a duplicate by comparing old vs. new in a test
        (Characterization-test like)
        Very useful when code can be hard to characterize ("legacy code")
    Overall group participation high
        good cohesion
    Inline just one usage to prepare for move
    Feeling like delivering code is important — self-imposed — slow down, check assumptions
    Like shortcuts being pushed on me
    AssertJ isEqualByComparingFieldByField was uses
        Also see usingRecursiveComparison
    Convert for loop to stream using IntelliJ IDEA's magic
For Next Time
    More like today


Retrospective: Mob #16 (Fri July 2, 2021)
-----------------------------------------

Thoughts, Learnings, etc.
    Ted's double-extract-method refactoring golf technique
    See the different approaches to refactoring during huddle
    Reminders about smaller steps and testing
    Manoj called huddle when needed
    Have a more explicit higher level goal
    Interesting contrast to a non-test situation
    Great discussion about encapsulation issue of cards and hand with respect to Player
    Don't forget to clean up the "trail" of changes left after chains of refactorings (e.g., method names)
    Pre-mob huddle and ad-hoc huddles to help clarify goals
    Feels like double-hop refactoring might be too much (other easier ways)
Next Time
    Navigator start with higher-level instructions rather than starting with details
        Trying to find balance between providing shortcuts and higher-level instructions
    Learn shortcuts
        Discuss for next time: push onto driver or let driver ask or let Navigator/Driver negotiate


Retrospective: Mob #15 (Fri June 25, 2021)
------------------------------------------
Learned
    Refresher for automated refactoring tools, understanding of purpose of moving — move to the right place, introduce params
    Took a complex task and broke it down into small actions
    Introduce parameter before moving method over to new class
    Extract Delegate
    Starting at the Domain very different approach than starting from the UI
    Nice to have review of Command & Query core definition
    Try the unfamiliar and maybe it's useful and will become familiar
    Cheat sheet!
        Practice what's there
        Be aware of what you're doing "manually", and try and remember to use the shortcut
        Maybe make your own?
Liked
    Picked a good task to work on
    Compound Refactorings
    Prepare refactor for new feature as a preliminary step
Next Time
    UNfold Code

Retrospective: Mob #14 (Fri June 18, 2021)
------------------------------------------
	Observations/Thoughts
		Felt lost the entire time, trouble finding our path
		Liked when Evan called for a huddle
		Less guessing and hoping
		Guessing really bugged me
		Liked when Bini reminded us to Predict before test running
		Being lost is uncomfortable, getting better at being lost in public
		Learned how to test-drive the new CSV repository and then just plugged it in and everything worked
		When tests failed after injecting, felt we weren't on the same page as to why they were failing — get together and understand why.
		Uncomfortable when doing some things that were not test-driven (when injecting and passing down thru call stack the new CSV repository)
		Hadn't run the Game in a long time! And it JUST WORKED.
		Got caught up in trying too hard to clarify test code

		Error stack trace: look at it
		Don't guess, look.
		Don't assume, look.
		Don't serialize through the screen — in the mob, you can be independent for a bit and come back to the mob with answers (diverge/converge)
		Forgot to run tests at the beginning
		Running not quite the right test as asked
		Time flew by!
		Feature is complete!
	Next Time
		Encourage people to ask for a huddle when lost +++
		Use more shortcuts!
		Use the time of handoff to evaluate whether what we're doing is worth it (e.g., clarifying code)
		Do independent "research" when in the crowd/mob.
		Turn off code folding


Retrospective: Mob #13 (Fri June 11, 2021)
------------------------------------------
	Learning/Takeaway
		Characterization test, to test the hypothesis that multiple games were on a single line, turned out not to be the case, disproving the hypothesis
			Characterization test vs. switching to debugger, staying in the work flow (+1)
		Consequences of moving test setup code to a "setup" method vs. a named method call in the test method
			Tradeoffs
		ZOMBIES in action, picking the right tests to move from zero, to one, and then to many
		Failed test to green by just hard-coding the correct answer in the code
		JUnit 5 @TempDir
	Observations
		Shorter huddles/hand-offs — doing the work, less "where are we" and coordination
			More "in sync", flow
		Be aware of specifying the Class name and the file number when multiple panes are open
		More focus on small steps, e.g., hard-coding
		Less "runaway driver" problem
			Learning from past experiences
		Navigator asking for help and mob swarmed for the answer
		More of the mob involved with "navigating", worked more closely together
		Stayed in the green (and noticed when in the red too long)
	Do or Not Do Next Time?
		More discussion? Asking "why are we doing this?" or "is there a better way to do that?"
		Need to be reminded of shortcuts for refactoring

Retrospective: Mob #12 (Sun June 6, 2021)
-----------------------------------------
	Observations
		Appreciated that Lada never hesitated to delete (redundant) code
		Driver careful/aware not run away from the Navigator
		Liked Ted checking on huddle being clear on what's happening and on the same page
		Started writing integration test that could have been unit test first
		Helpful to define carefully the behavior that's being tested before writing the test
		Bini great at providing feedback as Driver to clarify what Navigator was requesting
		Being mindful of what we're testing: what to keep, what to get rid of
		Question: how do we know when to take a step back?
		Noticed occasionally ‘mob start', but liked people confirming that it was done
		Mob is flowing much better: handoffs, etc.
	Next Time
		Technical "spike tests" are OK
		Try: Ted push shortcuts on Driver?
		Make sure the test behavior being tested is crystal clear, naming the method following Given/When/Then can help
		Keep ZOMBIES in mind
		Ted: Make sure to announce Driver & Navigator
		Keep Driver/Navigator order

Retrospective: Mob #11 (Fri June 4, 2021)
-----------------------------------------
	Observations
		In the red a lot less often than previous sessions
		Could have been in the red a lot less for Enum->String
		Predicting more than in the past
		Liked the new order of Driver-Navigator, handoff/transition seemed easier to continue (+2)
		Discussion around options for converting Enum to String, Coupling came up as a factor
			Helped to understand tradeoffs of options
		Refactoring test code is also important (+2)
			Refactoring to separate method felt like moving towards logic in test
		More conscious of smaller steps
		Detour into ParameterizedTest, which was a big step, led to refactoring to a method instead
		Discussion of test driving the very obvious implementation, vs. not test-driving at all and just finish implementation
			Driving the code vs. leaving regression tests behind
	Next Time
		Keep
			Driver + Navigator order & terminology
		Drop
			Don't push shortcuts on Driver unless asked
		Add
			Driver: Feel free to ask for shortcut
		Awareness
			How long in the red
			Size of steps
			Code being written without tests
			Precision Predictions


Retrospective: Mob #10 (Fri May 28, 2021)
-----------------------------------------
	Observations
		Code driving instead of test driving new code
		Typist thinking out loud
		Typist didn't do what the Navigator asked, and the Navigator didn't correct
			Typists not always asking clarifying questions
		Code formatting
			Lines are too long when window is split into two panes
				Avoid horizontally
		Tendency to run individual tests rather than all Unit Test
		Setup for stub decks is pretty verbose
		Good call for Mike to call a Huddle (when doing two things at once: format of GameOutcome and the result itself)
		Navigator burden held too heavily, could ask for guidance more often
		Take smaller steps
		Disabled test hung around for too long
		Avoid duplication of tests
		Transitions were a bit rough
	Suggestions
		Group mode was unclear: make more clear "Navigator is driving/thinking" vs. "Group huddling and discussing"
		Clarify Typist role: carries out Navigator's instructions/requests
			Typist can ask questions (say "I noticed this test is empty, should I delete?")
		Run All Unit Tests
			When to run All-All tests (incl. integration)
		Navigator: when handing off, explicitly state intent to next navigator: where we are and where we're going
			Call for Huddle if needed
	Like/Dislike
		Liked when team went into "huddle" mode to discuss and clarify intent
		Like: Ask Mob for help
		fail() breadcrumb
		Hard-coding to get test to pass
		Empty test was deleted

Retrospective: Mob #9 (Sat May 22, 2021)
----------------------------------------
(After 1 round)
* Need to work more on agreeing what the intent
* Fuzzy about where to go next
    * Discuss about where we're going
* Ask for a time-out to plan
* Red for 3 rotations, try to get to green faster
* Will try practicing with smaller steps

(After end)
* Best one overall
* Copying deck might have been too big of a step
* High tolerance for annoyances
* Delaying refactoring (including renames)
* Desire to get functionality implemented vs. tidying
* Make sure the error cause is clear before trying to fix
* Good use of shortcuts and asking about shortcuts

Next Time:
+ Mind map for retro next time
+ Game-plan huddle before starting (max 5m)
+ Call for huddle at any time (when lost, confused)
+ Hands/Eyes/Brain/Nose
    -> https://github.com/willemlarsen/mobprogrammingrpg
+ 90m-1h45m - hard stop at 1h45

Retrospective: Mob #8 (Fri May 21, 2021)
----------------------------------------

* More clarity of direction
* Liked retro in the middle (+1)
* Micro-test, focused on smaller classes
* Taking smaller steps
    * Create more, smaller classes
* Hard to remember in the "heat of the moment"
* Driving everything from the test
* Listen to that voice that says "is this becoming an integration test?"
* Notes in chat (+1)
* Don't be afraid to undo/throw away work <-- this is hard
* Shortcut of the day? Continue, maybe 2
* Try out T&C||R next time?
* Keep code & tests Tidy
* Test isolation: be able to understand without looking elsewhere
